Black box API:- API which is not controlled by us.We just recieve datas from that API.
    example:-"https://api.github.com/users/prabhat-mishra29".It gives data immediately.Suppose we want data after 3 sec for that case we create custom code. 

  [This module basicaly focuses on how to implement react-query]
  
#Steps:-
    >1st create 'package.json' file using 'npm init'. [npm-> node package manager]
    >Then create index.js
    >Now create your own script command for running files using 'package.json'
    >install 'express'.
    >Make type:module in package.json
    >Now go to 'index.js'.

    7.Now we move to frontend part.
    8.Create a vite_app.
    9.Remove 'CORS' error by creating 'proxy' in vite.config.js
        server: {
                  proxy:{
                    '/api':'http://localhost:3000',
                  },
                }, 
    10.Go to app.jsx.
    11.Learn about "react-query" in app.jsx.

    12.Learn about race-condition, how to cancel a fetch request and cleaning function , debouncing , throttling.

      Debouncing:-
        - Debouncing is a strategy used to improve the performance of a feature by controlling the time at which a function should be executed.

        - Debouncing accepts a function and transforms it in to an updated (debounced) function so that the code inside the original function is executed after a certain period of time.

      Throttling:-
        - Throttling is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function is called. Throttling transforms a function such that it can only be called once in a specific interval of time.
