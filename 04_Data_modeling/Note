1st question should come in our head,when we start a backend project:-
    -> Data but what is the type of data , what is the type of datafields we are going to use,what will be the data formats of that field.

    -> ["Kya store karr na hai and kesse store karna hai naa ki kahan store karna hai"]

#Stps:-
    1.1st create a structure of data model either using some tools or pen and papper.
    2.2nd we need a helper for object modeling or to present in code form.

        -> For data modeling we use a tool 'moon modeler'.["PAID"]
            > Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of an information system that shows the relationships between data points and structures.
            > Moon Modeler is a data modeling tool for MongoDB and Mongoose ODM.
            > It belongs to the data modeling and schema design tools category and can be used to create and visualize database structures.

        -> "Eraser.io" is a tool for engineering teams to create diagrams and documents.It works slightly different than 'moon modeler'.

        ["Sabse pehle dhyann main rakho kii user se kya kya information leke data main store karr ne bale hoo,ussi ke basis pai sare kamm karo."]

        -> you can follow your copy and pen for data structuring.

        -> We use 'mongoose' here.['for helper',another example:-'prisma']
            > Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
            > Mongoose is used to interact with MongoDB by providing a schema-based solution.
            > Moongse is a learning system that is based on requirements.

#For next part we use an online coding platform "stackblitz.com".
    >Create a new project in 'stackblitz' for backend-express.
    >install mongoose.
    >Create a models folder where we create our different model.
    >then go to 'stackblitz'.
