#Steps:-
    1.create backend first.
    2.create 'package.json' file using 'node.init'.
    3.Then create index.js
    4.Now create your own command for running files using 'package.json'
    5.install 'express'.
    6.Now go to 'index.js'.

    7.Now we move to frontend part.
    8.Create a vite_app.
    9.Go to app.jsx.

#Some bad practice that are followed by industry:-
    >They push 'backend' with 'frontend' folder directly to server/digital-ocean without using 'netify' for frontend.
    >Using 'npm run build' vite converts all data into a single folder called 'distribution' folder.
    >for use of 'proxy' and making same origin, people deploy 'dist' to backend.
    >Now we can use middlewires in 'index.js' from which we can serve static assets.
    >How to use middle wire:- app.use(express.static('dist'));
    >Now restart the backend.
    >Problem:-If any changes occur in backend it will not affect.But If any changes occur in frontend it will not propagate in original website.
    >Solution:-once again create 'dist' folder then push it to backend and restart the programe.[Kya baar baar create kare and restart kare]
